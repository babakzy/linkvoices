                <b>Lower fees and faster transaction:</b> Cryptocurrency transactions typically involve lower fees
                compared to traditional bank transfers or payment services, especially for international transfers.
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
                Faster transactions: Unlike bank transfers that can take days, especially across borders, cryptocurrency transfers are processed quickly, often within minutes, regardless of the destination.
            </p> -->
            <p>
                <b> No intermediaries & Decentralized:</b> Cryptocurrencies enable peer-to-peer transfers without the
                need for banks or other intermediaries, which can simplify the process and reduce costs.
                Cryptocurrencies are not controlled by any central authority
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Global accessibility:</b> Cryptocurrencies are accessible to anyone with an internet connection,
                making it
                easier for people in regions with limited banking infrastructure to participate in financial
                transactions.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>transparent, traceable, and secure: </b> as they are recorded on a public ledger that is difficult to
                alter
                or manipulate.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b> Privacy: </b> Cryptocurrency transactions can offer a higher degree of privacy compared to
                traditional
                banking, as users do not need to provide personal information beyond wallet addresses.
