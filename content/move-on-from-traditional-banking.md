# Why We Should Move On from Traditional Banking
The financial world is changing!
Traditional banking has been the backbone of our economy for decades, but it comes with several limitations and cons. Let’s see why moving beyond traditional banking systems to DeFi (Decentalized Finance) can benefit individuals and businesses.

## Centralized Systems vs Decentralized Systems
Traditional banks are centralized systems, meaning **all the power and control are in the hands of a few institutions.** 

**They decide how money flows, set fees, and even restrict access to your funds during or technical outages.** 

## decentralized systems
On the other hand, decentralized systems, like blockchain and cryptocurrency networks, empower individuals. 

In a decentralized system:
- Transactions happen directly between parties, reducing middlemen and costs.
- You control your funds at all times .no waiting for “banking hours.”

### Financial Freedom
Traditional banks often resist change and innovation. They work within a rigid framework that hasn’t kept pace with modern needs. Decentralized systems are built for the future. They offer:

### Smart contracts to automate agreements.
Tokenization of assets for easy trading.
Freedom from censorship and restrictions.
